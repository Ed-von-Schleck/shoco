**shoco**: a fast compressor for short strings
--------------------------------------------

**shoco** is a C library to compress and decompress short strings. It is [very fast](#comparisons-with-other-compressors) and [easy to use](#api). The default compression model is optimized for English words, but you can [generate your own compression model](#generating-compression-models) based on *your specific* input data.

**shoco** is free software, distributed under the [MIT license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ed-von-Schleck/shoco/master/LICENSE).

## Quick Start

Copy [shoco.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ed-von-Schleck/shoco/master/shoco.c), [shoco.h](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ed-von-Schleck/shoco/master/shoco.h) and [shoco_model.h](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ed-von-Schleck/shoco/master/shoco_model.h) from [github/shoco](https://github.com/Ed-von-Schleck/shoco) over to your project. Include `shoco.h` and you are ready to use the [API](#api)!

### API

Here is all of it:

```C
size_t shoco_compress(const char * in, size_t len, char * out, size_t bufsize);
size_t shoco_decompress(const char * in, size_t len, char * out, size_t bufsize);
```

If the `len` argument for `shoco_compress` is 0, the input char is assumed to be null-terminated. If it’s a positive integer, parsing the input will stop after this length, or at a null-char, whatever comes first. `shoco_decompress` however will need a positive integer for `len` (most likely you should pass the return value of `shoco_compress`).

The return value is the number of bytes written. If it is less than `bufsize`, all is well. In case of decompression, a null-terminator is written. If the return value is exactly `bufsize`, the output is all there, but _not_ null-terminated. It is up to you to decide if that’s an error or not. If the buffer is not large enough for the output, the return value will be `bufsize` + 1. You might want to allocate a bigger output buffer. The compressed string will never be null-terminated.

If you are sure that the input data is plain ASCII, your `out` buffer for `shoco_compress` only needs to be as large as the input string. Otherwise, the output buffer may need to be up to 2x as large as the input, if it’s a 1-byte encoding, or even larger for multi-byte or variable-width encodings like UTF-8.

For the standard values of _shoco_, maximum compression is 50%, so the `out` buffer for `shoco_decompress` needs to be a maximum of twice the size of the compressed string.

## How It Works

Have you ever tried compressing the string “hello world” with **gzip**? Let’s do it now:

```bash
$ echo "hello world" | gzip -c | wc -c
32
```

So the output is actually *larger* than the input string. And **gzip** is quite good with short input: **xz** produces an output size of 68 bytes. Of course, compressing short strings is not what they are made for, because you rarely need to make small strings even smaller – except when you do. That’s why **shoco** was written.

**shoco** works best if your input is ASCII. In fact, the most remarkable property of **shoco** is that the compressed size will *never* exceed the size of your input string, provided it is plain ASCII. What is more: An ASCII string is suitable input for the decompressor (which will return the exact same string, of course). That property comes at a cost, however: If your input string is not entirely (or mostly) ASCII, the output may grow. For some inputs, it can grow quite a lot. That is especially true for multibyte encodings such as UTF-8. Latin-1 and comparable encodings fare better, but will still increase your output size, if you don’t happen to hit a common character. Why is that so?

In every language, some characters are used more often than others. English is no exception to this rule. So if one simply makes a list of the, say, sixteen most common characters, four bits would be sufficient to refer to them (as opposed to eight bits – one byte – used by ASCII). But what if the input string includes an uncommon character, that is not in this list? Here’s the trick: We use the first bit of a `char` to indicate if the following bits refer to a short common character index, or a normal ASCII byte. Since the first bit in plain ASCII is always 0, setting the first bit to 1 says “the next bits represent short indices for common chars”. But what if our character is not ASCII (meaning the first bit of the input `char` is not 0)? Then we insert a marker that says “copy the next byte over as-is”, and we’re done. That explains the growth for non-ASCII characters: This marker takes up a byte, doubling the effective size of the character.

How **shoco** actually marks these packed representations is a bit more complicated than that (e.g., we also need to specify *how many* packed characters follow, so a single leading bit won’t be sufficient), but the principle still holds.

But **shoco** is a bit smarter than just to abbreviate characters based on absolute frequency – languages have more regularities than that. Some characters are more likely to be encountered next to others; the canonical example would be **q**, that’s *almost always* followed by a **u**. In English, *the*, *she*, *he*, *then* are all very common words – and all have a **h** followed by a **e**. So if we’d assemble a list of common characters *following common characters*, we can do with even less bits to represent these *successor* characters, and still have a good hit rate. That’s the idea of **shoco**: Provide short representations of characters based on the previous character.

This does not allow for optimal compression – by far. But if one carefully aligns the representation packs to byte boundaries, and uses the ASCII-first-bit-trick above to encode the indices, it works well enough. Moreover, it is blazingly fast. You wouldn’t want to use **shoco** for strings larger than, say, a hundred bytes, because then the overhead of a full-blown compressor like **gzip** begins to be dwarfed by the advantages of the much more efficient algorithms it uses.

If one would want to classify **shoco**, it would be an [entropy encoder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_encoding), because the length of the representation of a character is determined by the probability of encountering it in a given input string. That’s opposed to [dictionary coders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_coder) that maintain a dictionary of common substrings. An optimal compression for short strings could probably be achieved using an [arithmetic coder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding) (also a type of entropy encoder), but most likely one could not achieve the same kind of performance that **shoco** delivers.

How does **shoco** get the information about character frequencies? They are not pulled out of thin air, but instead generated by analyzing text with a relatively simple script. It counts all *bigrams* – two successive characters – in the text and orders them by frequency. If wished for, it also tests for best encodings (like: Is it better to spend more bits on the leading character or on the successor character?), and then outputs its findings as a header file for `shoco.c` to include. That means the statistical model is compiled in; we simply can’t add it to the compressed string without blowing it out of proportions (and defeating the whole purpose of this exercise). This script is shipped with **shoco**, and the [next section](#generating-compression-models) is about how *you* can use it to generate a model that’s optimized for *your* kind of data. Just remember that, with **shoco**, you need to control both ends of the chain (compression **and** decompression), because you can’t decompress data correctly if you’re not sure that the compressor has used the same model.

## Generating Compression Models

Maybe your typical input isn’t English words. Maybe it’s German or French – or whole sentences. Or file system paths. Or URLs. While the standard compression model of **shoco** should work for all of these, it might be worthwhile to train **shoco** for this specific type of input data.

Fortunately, that’s really easy: **shoco** includes a python script called `generate_compression_model.py` that takes one or more text files and outputs a header file ready for **shoco** to use. Here’s an example that trains **shoco** with a dictionary (btw., not the best kind of training data, because it’s dominated by uncommon words):

```bash
$ ./generate_compression_model.py /usr/share/dict/words -o shoco_model.h
```

There are options on how to chunk and strip the input data – for example, if we want to train **shoco** with the words in a readme file, but without punctuation and whitespace, we could do

```bash
$ ./generate_compression_model.py --split=whitespace --strip=punctuation README.md
```

Since we haven’t specified an output file, the resulting table file is printed on standard output.

This is most likely all you’ll need to generate a good model, but if you are adventurous, you might want to play around with all the options of the script: Type `generate_compression_model.py --help` to get a friendly help message. We won’t dive into the details here, though – just one word of warning: Generating tables can be slow if your input data is large, and _especially_ so if you use the `--optimize-encoding` option. Using [pypy](http://pypy.org/) can significantly speed up the process.

## Comparisons With Other Compressors

### smaz

There’s another good small string compressor out there: [**smaz**](https://github.com/antirez/smaz). **smaz** seems to be dictionary based, while **shoco** is an entropy encoder. As a result, **smaz** will often do better than **shoco** when compressing common English terms. However, **shoco** typically beats **smaz** for more obscure input, as long as it’s ASCII. **smaz** may enlarge your string for uncommon words (like numbers), **shoco** will never do that for ASCII strings.

Performance-wise, **shoco** is typically faster by at least a factor of 2. As an example, compressing and decompressing all words in `/usr/dict/share/words` with **smaz** takes around 0.325s on my computer and compresses on average by 28%, while **shoco** has a compression average of 33% (with the standard model; an optimized model will be even better) and takes around 0.145s. **shoco** is _especially_ fast at decompression.

**shoco** can be trained with user data, while **smaz**’s dictionary is built-in. That said, the maximum compression rate of **smaz** is hard to reach for **shoco**, so depending on your input type, you might fare better with **smaz** (there’s no way around it: You have to measure it yourself).

### gzip, xz

As mentioned, **shoco**’s compression ratio can’t (and doesn’t want to) compete with gzip et al. for strings larger than a few bytes. But for very small strings, it will always be better than standard compressors.

The performance of **shoco** should always be several times faster than about any standard compression tool. For testing purposes, there’s a binary inlcuded (unsurprisingly called `shoco`) that compresses and decompresses single files. The following timings were made with this command line tool. The data is `/usr/share/dict/words` (size: 4,953,680), compressing it as a whole (not a strong point of **shoco**):

compressor | compression time | decompression time | compressed size
-----------|------------------|--------------------|----------------
shoco      | 0.070s           | 0.010s             | 3,393,975
gzip       | 0.470s           | 0.048s             | 1,476,083
xz         | 3.300s           | 0.148s             | 1,229,980

This demonstrates quite clearly that **shoco**’s compression rate sucks, but also that it’s _very_ fast.

## Javascript Version

For showing off, **shoco** ships with a Javascript version (`shoco.js`) that’s generated with [emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten). If you change the default compression model, you need to re-generate it by typing `make js`. You do need to have emscripten installed. The output is [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/) with a small shim to provide a convenient API:

```js
compressed = shoco.compress(input_string);
output_string = shoco.decompress(compressed);
```

The compressed string is really a [Uint8Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Uint8Array), since that resembles a C string more closely. The Javascript version is not as furiously fast as the C version because there’s dynamic (heap) memory allocation involved, but I guess there’s no way around it.

`shoco.js` should be usable as a node.js module.

## Tools And Other Included Extras

Most of them have been mentioned already, but for the sake of completeness – let’s have a quick overview over what you’ll find in the repo:

#### `shoco.c`, `shoco.h`, `shoco_model.h`

The heart of the project. If you don’t want to bother with nitty-gritty details, and the compression works for you, it’s all you’ll ever need.

#### `models/*`

As examples, there are more models included. Feel free to use one of them instead of the default model: Just copy it over `shoco_model.h` and you’re all set. Re-build them with `make models`.

#### `training_data/*`

Some books from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/) used for generating the default model.

#### `shoco.js`

Javascript library, generated by **emscripten**. Also usable as a [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) module (put it in `node_modules` and `require` it). Re-build with `make js`.

#### `shoco.html`

A example of how to use `shoco.js` in a website.

#### `shoco`

A testing tool for compressing and decompressing files. Build it with `make shoco` or just `make`. Use it like this:

```bash
$ shoco compress file-to-compress.txt compressed-file.shoco
$ shoco decompress compressed-file.shoco decompressed-file.txt
```

It’s not meant for production use, because I can’t image why one would want to use **shoco** on entire files.

#### `test_input`

Another testing tool for compressing and decompressing every line in the input file. Build it with `make test_input`. Usage example:

```bash
$ time ./test_input < /usr/share/dict/words 
Number of compressed strings: 479828, average compression ratio: 33%

real   0m0.158s
user   0m0.145s
sys    0m0.013s
```

Adding the command line switch `-v` gives line-by-line information about the compression ratios.

#### `Makefile`

It’s not the cleanest or l33test Makefile ever, but it should give you hints for integrating **shoco** into your project.

#### `tests`

Invoke them with `make check`. They should pass.

## Things Still To Do

**shoco** is stable, and it works well – but I’d have only tested it with gcc/clang on x86_64 Linux. Feedback on how it runs on other OSes, compilers and architectures would be highly appreciated! If it fails, it’s a bug (and given the size of the project, it should be easy to fix). Other than that, there’s a few issues that could stand some improvements:

* There should be more tests, because there’s _never_ enough tests. Ever. Patches are very welcome!
* Tests should include model generation. As that involves re-compilation, these should probably written as a Makefile, or in bash or Python (maybe using `ctypes` to call the **shoco**-functions directly).
* The Python script for model generation should see some clean-up, as well as documentation. Also it should utilize all cpu cores (presumably via the `multiprocess`-module). This is a good task for new contributers!
* Again for model generation: Investigate why **pypy** isn’t as fast as should be expected ([jitviewer](https://bitbucket.org/pypy/jitviewer/) might be of help here).
* Make a real **node.js** module.
* The current SSE2 optimization is probably not optimal. Anyone who loves to tinker with these kinds of micro-optimizations is invited to try his or her hand here.
* Publishing/packaging it as a real library probably doesn’t make much sense, as the model is compiled-in, but maybe we should be making it easier to use **shoco** as a git submodule (even if it’s just about adding documentation), or finding other ways to avoid the copy&paste installation.
